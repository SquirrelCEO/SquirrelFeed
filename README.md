<h2>Switching Cameras</h2>


In order to change the active camera, type the command '!cam#' into chat where the # symbol is replaced with the number 1, 2, or 3. Here are the cameras we use:

- **!cam1** - pointing directly at the squirrel's house
- **!cam2** - located inside the house, pointing towards nut bowl
- **!cam3** - side view of house & bowl
- **!zoom1** is the same view of cam1, but zoomed in on the action
- More to come!


<h2>Feeding the Squirrels</h2>


Feeding the squirrels is straightforward: Simply type the command '!feed' into the chat and hit Enter. This should cause the on-camera feeder to dispense a few walnuts for the squirrels. 


<h2>Stream Schedule</h2>


Squirrels are most active at dawn and dusk. With that in mind, we have automated the stream to begin ~15 minutes before sunrise and end ~15 minutes after. Here's a [sun time table](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/dallas) for Dallas.


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>


<h3>Why didn't Nightbot respond to my command?</h3>

If you find that Nightbot doesn't respond to your command, ensure that you've added an exclamation point at the front of the command and not some other character. Here's a list of valid commands:

- **!feed**
- **!cam1**
- **!zoom1**
- **!cam2**
- **!cam3**

There is a 5s cooldown for any given command in chat.


<h3>No Nuts Fell :(</h3>

The squirrels like to reach up into the feeder to steal nuts. 

A solution is in the works, but for now let others know you've been wronged with !scam in chat
